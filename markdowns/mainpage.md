Hello! I'm TalonFox (aka Talon396)  
I mostly code stuff in Rust, Java, and Kotlin (though I know more languages). I enjoy writing baremetal programs, making small operating systems, and creating mods for games like Minecraft.
This is my personal website, I don't really have much on here, but I think I did a good job on it.
