Hello! I'm TalonFox (aka Talon396)  
I mostly code stuff in the Rust Programming Language. I enjoy writing baremetal programs and making small operating systems.  
This is my personal website, I don't really have much on here, but I think I did a good job on it.  
Its still a WIP so some features aren't complete yet.
